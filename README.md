## Author: Seth Hager
### Start date: August 29th 2021

Full stack college based social media project that connects a backend and a frontend to
achieve a working and deployed application.

Yacker is a project that is inspired by 4chan, Twitter, Craigslist, and the Afterschool App.

4chan is an anonymous image board that allows users to post whatever they please. Yacker will be essentially an anoymous image board that allows users to post whatever they please (within the realms of legality.)

Twitter is an inspiration as it has a modern UI and a young userbase. I want to create something for this audience that isn't as niche or gross as 4chan with a modern UI and user friendliness.

Craiglist is an inspiration because it is location based, and there is a craigslist for nearly every major city in every state. Which is important because I aim to include every major college in every major city.

And finally the Afterschool app, the afterschool app was not without controversies. I want to create something like this for colleges. The anonymity of the Afterschool app always created conversations in school, everyone was always talking about the latest thing that was posted, and speculating who posted it, and this is what I want for colleges.

**Backend stack:**
**nodeJS**
**postgresSQL**
**graphQL**
**prism**

**nodeJS**: I chose nodeJS strictly because it is the language I am most familiar with. It makes the most sense to me, as opposed to python, c#, java, or PHP. I like NPM a lot, I like the community a lot, and I have experience using it a lot. It can be using in production/deployment, and it is constantly improving.

**postgresSQL**: I have chosen postgresSQL because once I did some research I realized that perhaps mongoDB isn't the best selection; especially since previous imageboards have used mongoDB and then had to migrate to a relational database. My next choice was MySQL since I had the most experience with MySQL, but then once I did some research I realized that it would be easier to store IPV6 addresses in postgresSQL than in MySQL.

**graphQL**: GraphQL because it provides a nice interface with the database, and because I would like to learn more about it. When I first used it on a job interview assignment admittedly I struggled, so here I am trying to get better with it. If I could get real good with it then I wouldn't struggle connecting these client-side apps with these server-side apps, and that is a goal of mine.

**prism**: I love prism, it worked great from out of the box. The learning process was real easy for me, and I would love to use it to connect to a database again.

**Frontend stack:**
**HTML**
**CSS**
**Javascript**
**React**

Frontend stack: The usual suspects.

React: I selected react cause I have used it before and I enjoy working with it.
